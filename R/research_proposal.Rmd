# Introduction
Malaria remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa despite decades of progress through vector control interventions (add percentage and year). 
Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have been central to malaria control across the region, consistently reducing human–vector contact and suppressing transmission (Hobbs _et al._, 2023). ITNs have been reported to contribute to reductions of up to 50% in malaria incidence and 20% in malaria mortality (Zikayo et _al._, 2025), while IRS has been shown to reduce malaria incidence by approximately 50% (Harrison, 2025).
Regarding the mode of application, ITNs are long-acting control tools that provide protection for up to three years, whereas IRS is typically applied annually (Willson _et al._, 2015). Over the past two decades, ITNs have become the dominant malaria prevention tool due to their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and favorable safety profile (Batt _et al._, 2015). During most of this period, pyrethroids were the only WHO-recommended active ingredient for ITNs and the main insecticide class used in IRS (WHO, 2020), a constraint that simplified procurement and deployment but imposed strong selective pressure on a single insecticide class (Moyes _et al._, 2021). Notably, pyrethroids have also demonstrated the highest overall performance in malaria control compared to other insecticide classes (Zhou _et al._, 2022).

However, as ITN coverage expanded and usage intensified, resistance to pyrethroids emerged rapidly and unevenly across Africa, generating pronounced spatial and temporal heterogeneity in susceptibility among major Anopheles vectors (Hancock _et al._, 2020). Contributing to this heterogeneity, resistance in African _Anopheles_ arises through multiple, often co-occurring mechanisms (Kinsinza _et al._, 2017). Target-site mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc), commonly referred to as knockdown resistance (kdr), reduce pyrethroid binding affinity and impair knockdown efficacy. In parallel, metabolic resistance—mediated by elevated cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, and esterases—enhances detoxification capacity and survival following insecticide exposure (Khan _et al._, 2020). The prevalence of these mechanisms varies by species, region, and time, and their frequencies can shift rapidly under changing intervention pressures (Hancock, 2020; Kinsinza _et al._, 2017).

Continental-scale syntheses that integrate WHO bioassay results with molecular surveillance data (e.g., Vgsc genotype frequencies) have revealed species-specific regional trends and heterogeneous resistance trajectories, emphasizing the need for resistance-informed strategies rather than uniform, one-size-fits-all approaches (Hancock, 2020). Indoor insecticide-based interventions, particularly ITNs and IRS, tend to suppress endophilic and anthropophilic vectors such as _Anopheles gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ more strongly than the more exophagic _An. arabiensis_, leading to measurable shifts in species composition that can undermine the effectiveness of exclusively indoor tools and complicate routine entomological monitoring (Sinka _et al._, 2016).

Because resistance alters both survival and behavioural responses after insecticide contact, it is expected to reshape local vector abundance and community composition. Modelling and field studies indicate that ITNs can elicit divergent behavioural outcomes depending on their deterrent, inert, or attractive properties. Deterrent ITNs reduce mosquito entry and enhance personal protection but may decrease the likelihood of mosquitoes contacting treated surfaces, thus limiting community-level impact. Conversely, inert or attractive ITNs may increase mosquito entry and contact rates, enhancing mortality and reducing transmission when population-level coverage is high.

 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite growing evidence of widespread insecticide resistance among African malaria vectors, the development of new insecticidal compounds is neither a sustainable nor an immediate solution. The discovery, formulation, and regulatory validation of novel insecticides are time-consuming and costly, often requiring several years of intensive research. Consequently, robust spatiotemporal mapping of insecticide resistance is essential to guide decision-making and identify geographic areas where the deployment of new products would yield the greatest impact.
Although insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors is well documented and various modeling frameworks have been developed, resistance mapping remains uncertain. Existing approaches often have significant limitations:
- They focus on limited regions or species, failing to capture broader geographic and taxonomic heterogeneity.
- Current phenotypic resistance maps do not adequately reflect resistance within species complexes and do not capture the mechanisms under the resistance
- Models based solely on allele frequencies oversimplify resistance evolution, ignoring key factors such as dominance effects, fitness trade-offs, and interactions among multiple loci that together shape the phenotypic expression and spread of resistance.
Previous studies, such as those analyzing Vgsc-995S and Vgsc-995F mutations, focused on a single target-site gene, revealing geographically structured patterns and the influence of ITN coverage on allele frequencies (Hancock, 2022). However, resistance is often polygenic, involving multiple target-site and metabolic mechanisms that interact to influence species composition and relative abundance under realistic intervention pressures. Consequently, a multilocus genotype approach, which accounts for allele combinations arising from recombination, is essential to capture dominance patterns, resistance expression, and to predict the speed and extent of resistance spread under different intervention pressures. The effect of intervention on the relative abundance and species composition in a population composed by resistant and susceptible are not well understood. 
The effect of interventions on the relative abundance and species composition of populations composed of both insecticide-resistant and susceptible mosquitoes is not well understood. Current models of _Anopheles_ relative abundance remain limited. For example, Sinka _et al._, 2010 modeled the relative abundance of primary African vectors before and after indoor insecticide interventions, and Killeen _et al.,_ 2000 developed a simulation model of African Anopheles ecology for malaria transmission analysis. While these studies advanced understanding of vector population dynamics, they often assume homogeneous susceptibility within species and do not fully integrate insecticide resistance, spatiotemporal variation in intervention coverage, or resulting shifts in species composition. Consequently, such models may underestimate residual transmission and fail to accurately identify areas requiring supplementary or alternative vector control strategies, limiting their utility for evidence-based planning.


## Research questions 
To address gaps in understanding the interaction between resistance evolution and vector control, this study explores three key questions:
- How has insecticide resistance been modeled over time?
- How do interventions and resistance influence changes in _Anopheles_ abundance?
- How does resistance vary over time among different Anopheles species and regions in Africa?

## Research objectives
-	Main objective 
The main objective of this study is to estimate and develop a  spatiotemporal trends in insecticide resistance and the relative abundance of Anopheles species after intervention. 

The specific objectives are:
O1: Review of current insecticide resistance models: To review existing models of insecticide resistance, including the evolutionary processes considered, types of data used, and model structures
02: Spatiotemporal model of the relative abundance of Anopheles species: To investigate how insecticide resistance affects changes in _Anopheles_ relative abundance following ITN and IRS deployment
O3: Spatiotemporal model of insecticide resistance in _Anopheles_: To integrate phenotypic (bioassay mortality) and genotypic (multi-locus allele frequencies such as kdr and ace-1) data to characterize spatiotemporal trends in resistance

## Scope of the study
Sustaining the effectiveness of malaria vector control interventions in Africa requires a deep understanding of the genetic basis and dynamics of insecticide resistance. Current strategies are constrained by limited knowledge of how multi-locus resistance mechanisms interact and influence Anopheles populations under real-world coverage of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). 
Integrating entomological surveillance with phenotypic and genotypic resistance data in a spatiotemporal modeling framework allows us to capture patterns of species replacement, monitor the evolution of resistance, and identify areas where interventions may be less effective. This approach provides essential insights for evidence-based decision-making, enabling the optimization and targeted deployment of malaria control measures.
Optimal deployment of interventions depends on local resistance profiles, coverage histories, and vector ecology. Without an explicit framework linking genotype-informed resistance to vector abundance responses under realistic deployment scenarios, it remains difficult to:
- Prioritize products for deployment.
- Schedule rotations of insecticides effectively.
- Forecast downstream effects on malaria transmission.
